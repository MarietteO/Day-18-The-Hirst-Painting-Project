<h2>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023</h2>
<h3>Section 18: Day 18 - Intermediate - Turtle & the Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>

Understanding Turtle Graphics and how to use the Documentation<br>
Importing Modules, Installing Packages and Working with Aliases<br>

Avoid writing (e.g.,): <br>
